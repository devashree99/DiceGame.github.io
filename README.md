The Dice Game project is a simple web-based game that simulates a two-player dice rolling competition. The objective of the game is to accumulate points by rolling a virtual dice and strategically deciding when to hold and pass the turn to the other player. The game features a user interface that displays player scores, the current round's score, and a visual representation of the rolled dice

Gameplay Mechanics:
Players take turns rolling the dice by clicking the "Roll" button.
The dice roll generates a random number between 1 and 6.
If a player rolls a number other than 1, the rolled number is added to their current round score.
If a player rolls a 1, their current round score is reset to 0, and the turn is passed to the other player.
Players can choose to "Hold" their current round score, which adds it to their total score.
The first player to reach a predefined winning score is declared the winner.
